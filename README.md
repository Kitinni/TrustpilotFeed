**About this extension**

This extension adds the ability to add Trustpilot's trustbox to your Magento Store via php. Improving page load time compared to the javascript version and improving readability of those reviews for search engines.

The feed can be added either via XML (by default it is added in the right column) or as a widget in most locations on the pages you choose.

The extension pulls the JSON feed via your Trustpilot account and based on the settings you have specified uses this to display the feed on the page.
